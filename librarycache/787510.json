With their massive size and seemingly endless numbers, they conquered most of Eurasia In the span of a few decades, and it’s only a matter of time before the rest of the globe falls as well. Mankind’s last hope are the Tactical Surface Fighters: powerful humanoid machines that can stand up to the alien threat. But the enemy’s numbers grow greater by the day, and we’ll need new and better weapons if we’re to have any hope of survival… \r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/787510/extras/TE戦術機02.gif?t=1682502778[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/787510/extras/TE_steam_banner_w614-h64_STORY.png?t=1682502778[/img]\r\n\r\nMay 2001. Yukon Base, Alaska, is home to Project Prominence, an international Tactical Surface Fighter (TSF) development initiative. Here, the best pilots and engineers in the world gather to make the weapons that will save mankind’s future. \r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/787510/extras/yukon.jpg?t=1682502778[/img]\r\nAfter his involvement in a fatal training accident, maverick American test pilot Yuuya Bridges is removed from his unit and assigned to Argus Flight, a TSF development unit based in the frigid Alaskan wastes. There, he will work with a joint American &amp; Japanese R&amp;D team to build a new, next-generation fighter for the Empire of Japan. \r\n\r\nFrom the moment he arrives, his cocky, anti-social attitude puts him at odds with the other members of his team, from his fellow test pilots to the project's overseer and his direct superior, the stern and by-the-book Lieutenant Takamura Yui.\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/787510/extras/yuixyuya.jpg?t=1682502778[/img]\r\nYui is the daughter of a traditional samurai household, who was the only survivor of her unit during the battle where the Empire’s capital was destroyed. Traumatized by the events of the battle and devoted to her family’s code of honor, she’s dedicated herself completely to her mission, which makes her constantly clash with Yuuya. Their constant fighting soon puts the whole project in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, Yuuya comes to realize that Yukon Base is rife with international intrigue, as each nation tries to steal each other’s secrets and ensure that when the war against the BETA is over, they’ll be the ones with the most powerful weapons. \r\n\r\nAs the alien threat grows greater by the day, can he overcome his differences with Yui and complete the weapon that will end the BETA threat forever?","strSnippet":"As mankind races to create new weapons to turn the tide in its war against alien invaders, Yuuya, a hot-headed American pilot, is assigned to work with a beautiful but cold Japanese officer on a top-secret project. Can they learn to work together in time to make the weapon that saves us all?"}}]]
