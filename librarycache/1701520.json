great deity created the world named Engardin, leaving four goliaths before her departure. The Goliaths abided by their different divine callings and upheld the order and flow of this world. Hence, the lives in Engardin reincarnated and multiplied.\r\n\r\nHumans were the last creation, and their ever-expanding ambitions led to a protracted war against the Goliaths. Engardin was engulfed in flames, until a huge explosion known as &quot;The Razing&quot; devastated the Holy Grounds of mankind and brought a swift end to the conflict. But the divine order was broken, and lives withered away. The age of mankind came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe survivors of the conflict scattered across Engardin. Severed from the Well of Mankind and unable to reincarnate, they banded together to form settlements. Years have passed since this great cataclysm, and the remaining human settlements have been suddenly assaulted by mystic forces. Renee, a young amnesiac girl and student of Aros, was the lone survivor of the attack on her village. Determined to recover her forgotten memories and locate her lost mentor, she bids farewell to her destroyed village to embark on a journey that will inexplicably set into motion a series of events that will determine the fate of this new world.\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1701520/extras/1.gif?t=1710279708[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1701520/extras/Steam-Text_GAMEPLAY.png?t=1710279708[/img][h2][b]Experience a gorgeous hand-drawn world [/b][/h2]\r\nEngardin is not only filled with sublime beauty but also plagued by crises.
