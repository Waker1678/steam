new JRPG from AQUAPLUS, announced in commemoration of 20 years of their hit [i]Utawarerumono[/i] franchise. Produced by legendary composer Naoya Shimokawa and penned by [i]Utawarerumono[/i] writer Munemitsu Suga, with support from the studio's superb art direction spearheaded by character designer Mi, [i]Monochrome Mobius: Rights and Wrongs Forgotten[/i] focuses on the heart of every great RPG: the story.\r\n\r\n[h2]Story[/h2]\r\nIn the small province of Ennakamuy, on the frontiers of the great empire of Yamato, there lived a young man with his mother and sister. One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he encountered a girl he’d never met.\r\n\r\nThe words the girl spoke were what shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive.\r\nSeeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man and the girl set out together towards the land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn’t appear on the map.\r\n\r\nFaced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father.\r\nHe meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission.\r\nThere will be struggles and victories and failures and partings.\r\nThe fickle vagaries of fate will place an epoch in the young man’s hands—\r\n\r\nAnd one day, this man will be sung of in legends.\r\n\r\n[h2]Characters[/h2]\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962430/extras/01_oshtor_alt.png?t=1712214475[/img]\r\nA young man living in the frontier province of Ennakamuy. Oshtor lives together with his mother Torikori and his younger sister Nekone, and though still young, he possesses discipline and a strong sense of right and wrong. His meeting with the mysterious Shunya gives him questions about his father’s death, and he sets out for an unknown country to find answers.\r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962430/extras/02_shunya_alt.png?t=1712214475[/img]\r\nA girl whose path has crossed Oshtor’s by chance or by destiny. Guileless and still with something of a babyface, Shunya's words and actions create more questions than they answer. She informs Oshtor that his father, whom he thought a martyr, still lives, and the pair embark on a journey together.\r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962430/extras/03_munechika_alt.png?t=1712214475[/img]\r\nThe daughter of Murasame, the ruler of Izumo. As demure and polite as she appears, Munechika shows hints of a warrior spirit. She assists Oshtor and joins him on his mission.\r\n\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1962430/extras/04_mikazuchi_alt.png?t=1712214475[/img]\r\nA young man who barged in on Oshtor when he was training. Mikazuchi is strong and somewhat brash, but he never bends for anything, and a current of integrity runs through everything he does. A good friend to Oshtor and a good rival too, the two spur each other on through thick and thin.","strSnippet":"A new JRPG from veteran studio AQUAPLUS, commemorating 20 years of the multi-media Utawarerumono series.
