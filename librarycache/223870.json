the Game\n\nAs the dust settled from the events of Ys I, young red-haired adventurer Adol Christin found himself standing upon the floating continent of Ys – a lost civilization that the people of Esteria had no idea hung right above their heads. Here in this forgotten land, he was fated to encounter greater demons than he’d ever faced before, along with human sacrifice, powerful magic and dark remnants of a tragedy that occurred over 700 years before.\nConfronted with new challenges that would guide him from a frozen glacier to the depths of a volcano to the innermost sanctum of an ancient society’s holiest temple, Adol was to take on the role of mage for the first time here, using forgotten spells, enchanted items and mystical creatures to help him save the day and fulfill the role he’d long been prophesied to serve.\nExperience the 1988 classic sequel to the original Ys in its most up-to-date, modernized form. This is the journey that made Adol famous and cemented his role in gaming history, and serves as a wonderful payoff to the buildup of Ys I.\nBest experienced after completing its predecessor.\n\nKey Features:\n\n•\tClassic buttonless “bump” combat returns, joined by a robust magic system.\n•\tTransform into a demon to speak with any and every standard enemy in the game, creating unparalleled depth that still impresses even to this day.\n•\tSoundtrack selectable from among the original 1988 FM-synth, a 2002 MIDI-style remix or a modern studio performance by Falcom’s in-house rock band.\n•\tCharacter art selectable from old-style 2002 portraits or more modern designs.\n•\tFour selectable difficulty levels and optional boss rush mode grant players a true old-school challenge if desired.\n•\tUnique Steam Achievements plus Steam Cloud support and leaderboards. \n•\tAdjustable high-resolution PC graphics with a smooth, consistent framerate.\n•\tGreater viewing area than in previously-available Ys I & II Chronicles editions.\n•\tDecorative screen frames available from the earlier Japan-only Ys I & II Complete PC release, in addition to the more modernized full-screen viewport of previous Ys I & II Chronicles editions.\n","strSnippet":"About the Game As the dust settled from the events of Ys I, young red-haired adventurer Adol Christin found himself standing upon the floating continent of Ys – a lost civilization that the people of Esteria had no idea hung right above their heads."}}]]
