there was an ancient kingdom called Ys which prospered under the auspices of two heavenly Goddesses. Over time, the kingdom came to be known as Esteria, and its divine history was largely forgotten by all but the descendants of those who once preached the Goddesses’ will. The only reminder of this lost lore was a cursed spire at the foot of a giant crater, which locals came to regard as “The Devil’s Tower.”\r\n\r\nEventually, the men and women who called Esteria their home began mining a uniquely radiant silver from the nearby mountains, and development boomed. Towns were built, and the land became rich with life.\r\n\r\nThen, all at once, monsters began to appear. Only a few at first – but soon enough, the land was swarming with them, and the Esterians had no choice but to hide in fear, remaining ever vigilant just to stay alive.\r\n\r\nOur story begins with a young man who’d heard rumors of these misfortunes, and strove to verify them with his own eyes; a brave swordsman with an adventurous spirit bolstered by his own youthful naiveté. \r\n\r\nHis name was Adol Christin.\r\n\r\nWith no regard for his own safety, Adol set sail toward Esteria through a heretofore impassable barrier of neverending storms. There, he was destined to become ensconced within a 700 year-old mystery that would ultimately take him to a long-lost land nestled amongst the clouds...\r\n\r\nYs I &amp; II Chronicles+ is the most modernized and up-to-date remake of Falcom’s classic franchise-spawning action RPGs from 1987 and 1988. Come see how the story began, and witness the birth of a legend!\r\n\r\n[h2]Key Features[/h2]\r\n[list][*]\tClassic buttonless “bump” combat receives a full analog-enabled upgrade for gamepad users, and is augmented in Ys II by a robust magic system.\r\n[*]\tSoundtrack selectable from among the original 80s FM-synth, an early 2000s MIDI-style remix or a modern studio performance by Falcom’s in-house rock band.\r\n[*]\tCharacter art selectable from 90s-style portraits or more modern anime designs.\r\n[*]\tFour selectable difficulty levels and optional boss rush mode grant players a true old-school challenge (if desired).\r\n[*]\tTransform into a demon to speak with any and every standard enemy in the game, creating unparalleled depth that still impresses even to this day. (Ys II only)\r\n[*]\tUnique Steam Achievements plus Steam Cloud support and leaderboards. \r\n[*]\tAdjustable high-resolution PC graphics with a smooth, consistent framerate.\r\n[*]\tGreater viewing area than in previously-available Ys I &amp; II Chronicles editions.\r\n[*]\tDecorative screen frames available from the earlier Japan-only Ys I &amp; II Complete PC release, in addition to the more modernized full-screen viewport of previous Ys I &amp; II Chronicles editions.\r\n[/list]","strSnippet":"Long, long ago, there was an ancient kingdom called Ys which prospered under the auspices of two heavenly Goddesses.
