They set sail to search the sunken ruins of his grandmother's laboratory in order to find a treasure rumor says she left there.\r\n\r\nBut what they find is not riches or jewels; it is a strange girl lying asleep in a coffin at the bottom of the sea.\r\nAtri.\r\n\r\nAtri is a robot, but her appearance and her wealth of emotions would fool anyone into think she's a living, breathing human being. In gratitude for being salvaged, she makes a declaration to Natsuki.\r\n\r\n&quot;I want to fulfill my master's final order. Until I do, I'll be your leg!&quot;\r\n\r\nIn a little town slowly being enveloped by the ocean, an unforgettable summer is about to begin for this boy and this mysterious robot girl...\r\n\r\n[h2]CHARACTER[/h2]\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1230140/extras/character_natsuki_en.png?t=1702356546[/img]\r\n[b]Ikaruga Natsuki[/b]\r\n[i][h2]&quot;What's the point in going to school?
