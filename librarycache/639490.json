The remaining life in the old family head who has built up a vast fortune is very slim.\r\n\r\nTo his children, the greatest point of contention at this family conference is the distribution of his inheritance. \r\nEveryone desires all that money, no one relents, and no one believes.\r\n\r\nWho will gain the old head's vast inheritance? Where is the 10 tons of gold that the old head is said to have hidden? Can the unnerving riddle of the epitaph which is said to point to the location of that gold be solved?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this, a suspicious letter is sent from one claiming to be a witch. The presence of a 19th person on this island, which should only have 18, begins to hang in the air.\r\n\r\nBrutal murders repeat, and unsolvable riddles are left at the scene. How many will die? How many will live? Or will everyone die?\r\n\r\nIs the culprit one of the 18, or not?\r\nIs the culprit a &quot;human&quot;, or a &quot;witch&quot;?\r\n\r\nPlease, enjoy this isolated island, western mansion, mystery-suspense gadget of the good old days to the fullest.","strSnippet":"This is the 2nd half of the Umineko When They Cry sound novel series, featuring episodes 5 through 8.
