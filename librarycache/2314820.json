But these unlucky individuals do not return as the person they once were. They rise from the grave with depleted cognition, memory, and awareness. Their bodies, stripped of all regenerative abilities, slowly rot away.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, those with this affliction are known as &quot;hihiru.&quot; Though once revered as holy beings, over time they have come to be shunned and reviled by society. Eventually, however, their condition was recognized as a medical issue, and given the name Aerodema.\r\n\r\nNow, at the dawn of the Taishō Era, Dr. Shūhei Katori is conducting field studies in an effort to improve living conditions and support systems for Aerodema patients. Given how slowly they have developed in Japan compared to other nations, it is an uphill battle he fights.\r\n\r\nIt is through the eyes of two men that this story will unfold: Masamitsu Chigusa, a young doctor assisting with these studies, and Takeo Tenma, a student to whom Aerodema has only been a distant problem until now. Watch how these men grapple with Aerodema as it twists itself into their lives...\r\n\r\n＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿\r\n\r\n[h2][b]【STAFF】[/b][/h2]\r\n\r\n[b]Planning &amp; Scenario[/b]: Renya Setoguchi\r\n[b]Character Design[/b]: Zennosuke\r\n[b]Music[/b]: MANYO\r\n[b]UI Design[/b]: Kenzo Nagaoka\r\n[b]Developmen[/b]t: BA-KU\r\n[b]Production[/b]: ANIPLEX.EXE","strSnippet":"\"Hira Hira Hihiru\" is a visual novel set in a fictional Taishō Era.
