The city has been plagued by a string of serial murders.\r\nThe detectives of the 24 Wards Heinous Crimes Unit have their sights set on one particular suspect: Kamui Uehara, legendary serial killer and perpetrator of a number of assassinations of government officials 20 years prior in the now-famous &quot;Silver Case&quot;. However, nobody knows who - or what - Kamui really is.\r\n\r\nIs this really the second coming of Kamui? Who is this infamous serial killer, and what is his endgame?\r\n\r\nTake control of the protagonist - a member of the Special Forces Unit known as “Republic” - from a first-person perspective and dig deep into the underground of the 24 Wards and the police force itself to unravel the various interconnected mysteries encountered throughout the game. Inspired by classic adventure and visual novel-style games as well as neo-noir and hardboiled detective films, The Silver Case provides a unique and revolutionary gameplay experience as it leads you through deep and engaging storylines filled with puzzles and riddles. Uncover the truth piece by piece as you struggle to survive in this dark and dangerous world where the stakes are even higher than they seem!\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/476650/extras/2017-05-19.png?t=1613724291[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Kamui Uehara[/b]\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/476650/extras/001_s.png?t=1613724291[/img]\r\nA dyed-in-the-wool psychopath who gained the title of “the King of Crime” after stabbing a government official to death. Kamui’s motive is completely shrouded in mystery, and it is not known whether he’s acting alone or following orders from some higher power. His victims are major witnesses of suspicious industrial disasters and persons of interest in legal cases which cannot be tried under the current system.\r\n\r\n[b]Sumio Kodai[/b]\r\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/476650/extras/147414.jpg?t=1613724291[/img]\r\nA straight-laced, mid-level investigator in the 24 Wards Heinous Crimes Unit.
