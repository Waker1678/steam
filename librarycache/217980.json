You are the once-trusted bodyguard of the beloved Empress. Framed for her murder, you become an infamous assassin, known only by the disturbing mask that has become your calling card. In a time of uncertainty, when the city is besieged by plague and ruled by a corrupt government armed with industrial technologies, dark forces conspire to bestow upon you abilities beyond those of any common man â€“ but at what cost? The truth behind your betrayal is as murky as the waters surrounding the city, and the life you once had is gone forever.\r\n[h2]Key features:[/h2]\r\n[list][*][b]Improvise and Innovate[/b]\r\n\r\nApproach each assassination with your own style of play.
