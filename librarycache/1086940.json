Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.\r\n\r\nFrom the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Gather_new.gif?t=1711532262[/img]\r\n\r\nChoose from 12 classes and 11 races from the D&amp;D Player's Handbook and create your own identity, or play as an Origin hero with a hand-crafted background. Or tangle with your inner corruption as the Dark Urge, a fully customisable Origin hero with its own unique mechanics and story.

You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Next_Gen_new.gif?t=1711532262[/img]\r\n\r\nForged with the new Divinity 4.0 engine, Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment, and interact with a thriving world filled with characters, dangers, and deceit. A grand, cinematic narrative brings you closer to your characters than ever before. From shadow-cursed forests, to the magical caverns of the Underdark, to the sprawling city of Baldur’s Gate itself, your actions define the adventure, but your choices define your legacy. You will be remembered.  \r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1086940/extras/Experience_Depth.png?t=1711532262[/img]\r\n\r\nThe Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed, and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you – verticality is a vital part of exploration. Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you journey from the depths of the Underdark to the glittering rooftops of Baldur’s Gate. Every choice you make drives your story forward, each decision leaving your mark on the world. Define your legacy, nurture relationships and create enemies, and solve problems your way. No two playthroughs will ever be the same.\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1086940/extras/01_Bullets_points.png?t=1711532262[/img]\r\n[list]allows you to combine your forces in combat and simultaneously attack enemies, or split your party to each follow your own quests and agendas.

What becomes of them is up to you, as you enter real, vibrant relationships with those you meet along the way. Each companion has their own moral compass and will react to the choices you make throughout your journey. At what cost will you stick to your ideals? Will you allow love to shape your actions? The relationships made on the road to Baldur’s Gate act as moments of respite at camp as much as they add weight to the many decisions you make on your adventure.
