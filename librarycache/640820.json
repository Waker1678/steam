Enjoy a classic RPG experience inspired by games like Baldur's Gate, Fallout 1 and 2 and Arcanum. Explore and conquer the Stolen Lands and make them your kingdom!\r\n\r\nBased on our players' feedback and suggestions, this version of the game improves and builds upon the original. This edition includes: \r\nâ€¢ numerous gameplay-enriching content additions and dozens of quality-of-life features\r\nâ€¢ new abilities and ways to build your character, including a brand-new class\r\nâ€¢ new items and weaponry\r\nâ€¢ improved balance, especially in the beginning and last two chapters of the game\r\nâ€¢ enhanced kingdom management system, both in terms of balance as well as usability and player comfort\r\nâ€¢ increased variety of random encounters on the global map\r\nâ€¢ thousands of fixes and improvements made since the game's initial release\r\n\r\nExplore the Stolen Lands, a region that has been contested territory for centuries: Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your markâ€”by building your own kingdom! To do so, youâ€™ll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nationsâ€¦ as well as threats within your own court.\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/640820/extras/Gif_01_V2_-_Copy.jpg?t=1699437151[/img]\r\n\r\nCustomize your character with a wide range of classes and powers including specialized archetypes, powerful arcane and divine spells, choosing from a multitude of class abilities, skills, and feats. Pathfinder allows players to create heroes (or villains) that fit both their individual gameplay styles and their personalities.\r\n\r\nMeet a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. Youâ€™ll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and youâ€™ll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/640820/extras/Gif_04_-_Copy.jpg?t=1699437151[/img]\r\n\r\nConquer new regions as claim them as your own, carving your kingdom from the wilderness. While classic dungeon crawling and exploration lie at the heart of this adventure, diplomacy, politics, and kingdom development are also part of the challenge. Choose your allies well, and keep them close while exploring ancient tombs and ruins â€” and while dealing with politics in your own court. \r\n\r\nYour kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with. As your kingdom grows, a number of factions and neighboring countries will come to you to seek favorâ€”and to test your strength.\r\n\r\n[img]https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/640820/extras/Gif_03.jpg?t=1699437151[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]Explore - Conquer - Rule![/b]\r\n\r\nThe Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is an evolution of the 3.5 rules set of the world's oldest fantasy roleplaying game, designed by Paizo, Inc using the feedback of tens of thousands of gamers just like you. Whether youâ€™re new to the PathfinderÂ® universe or youâ€™re a seasoned veteran, Pathfinder: Kingmaker is the CRPG youâ€™ve been waiting for.","strSnippet":"Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Enhanced Plus Edition is the first isometric party-based computer RPG set in the Pathfinder fantasy universe.
